A Kotlin Multiplatform project to help people figure out what clothing to wear, based on their 
calendar events, the expected weather for where they are and where they will be and personal
preferences. It will later use machine learning to help, but initially it will allow them to 
anonymously give data to help train the model.

This is also an example of how to use some of the modern libraries in a KMP application and will be
the subject of a YouTube video shortly.
